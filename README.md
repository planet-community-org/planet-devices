# planet-devices

Repository for Planet Computers devices. Use this for feature requests, bugs,
and *constructive* feedback. It also contains a community wiki.

As a interim measure, I (@shymega) setup this issue tracker to later be
maintained officially by Planet Computers, for the community to report
bugs/issues, provide feature requests, and give constructive feedback.

However, I must stress that the frustration felt by many in the PC community
should be avoided here. I want this tracker to be a constructive medium, and
repetitive posts on how the Astro or other devices are delayed will be removed.
We need to be positive. It will come.

Respect and politeness are a must. No one deserves to be personally attacked, or
accused of being a Planet 'shill'.

Enjoy!
